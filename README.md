# What is a Polar Grid? #

A polar grid can be defined as a circular grid that contain radial dividers
and concentric rings. Polar grids are useful for visualizing data, but this
script is not for that (I recommend matplotlib if that is what you're after).
This script lets us derive the geometry required to build a coordinate grid
for use in spatial analysis applications.

It was built because I have not come accross any tools in a GIS that allow
you to build a polar grid. Rather, we are left to first building a circle (buffer),
then dividing that buffer into multiple radial sections (pizza triangles), and
further subdivide that into circular concentric rings.
